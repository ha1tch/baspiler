Create an HTML5 canvas game that simulates the functionality of a BASIC compiler. The game should interpret BASIC code that uses the Pico-8 palette, defining sprites as pixmap arrays based on Pico-8 palette indexes. All sprite definitions must be processed in memory before the game starts. The final output should be a single HTML5 file that encapsulates all game elements.
