Generate an HTML5 Canvas game acting as if you were a BASIC compiler. 
The BASIC code assumes we are using the Pico8 palette, and the definitions
of sprites use Pico8 palette indexes to define the sprites as pixmap arrays. 

Thus, when compiled targeting HTML5 + Javascript, the sprites are generated 
in Javascript in memory using the pixmap definitions before the game starts. 

The complete game must be generated as a single HTML5 file that contains 
everything.

Here's the BASIC source code:
